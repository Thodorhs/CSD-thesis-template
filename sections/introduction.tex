\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Problem statement
  \begin{itemize}
    \item High data growth problem and dram capacity scaling decreases
    \item Big data frameworks require more memory
  \end{itemize}

  \item Possible approaches for more memory
  \begin{itemize}
    \item local storage device (e.g., NVMe SSD) or remote storage device or
      remote memory 
    \item Remote storage device or remote memory in case of disaggregated
      datacenter
    \item Storage device provide higher capacity than remote memory
    \item Remote memory has lower latency
    \item SPDK-nvme-of can reduce device latency
  \end{itemize}

  \item Evaluation of existing approaches in the context of managed big data
    frameworks 
  \item We use TeraHeap which is the state of the art

  \item {Evaluation + some high level results}
\end{itemize}
